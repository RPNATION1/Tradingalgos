# Trading Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of trading algorithms developed for various platforms such as MetaTrader, TradingView, and other trading platforms. The algorithms include various trading strategies and technical indicators, ranging from simple moving average crossovers to more complex approaches like Bollinger Bands, RSI, and Williams Alligator strategies.

## Disclaimer

The code and strategies presented in this repository are for educational and informational purposes only. They should not be considered as financial advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any financial instrument. Trading carries inherent risks, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Please use these algorithms and strategies at your own risk. Consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to the different trading platforms and languages:

- MetaTrader (MQL4, MQL5)
- TradingView (Pine Script)
- Python (for custom trading bots)

Inside each folder, you'll find separate files for each strategy or indicator, with a brief description of the algorithm's functionality and the trading instruments it can be applied to.

## How to Use

To use any of the algorithms, simply navigate to the folder corresponding to the platform you're using, and copy the code from the file containing the strategy or indicator you're interested in. Then, paste the code into the appropriate editor or interface for your trading platform.

Please refer to the documentation or user guide for your specific platform for instructions on how to implement custom code.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an improvement or a new strategy to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Please make sure that your code is well-commented and follows the same structure as the existing algorithms.
